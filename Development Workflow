📊 CI/CD PowerBI Git Branching Workflow

This project uses a linear history workflow with 3 main branches:
- Prod — live, production-ready state
- Test — staging for QA and validation
- Dev — active development

---

🔀 Branching Flow:

Dev → Test → Prod

- New features are developed in Dev.
- Approved changes are moved to Test for QA.
- Validated changes are promoted to Prod.

---

📦 Commands and Workflow

✅ Develop in Dev:

git checkout Dev
# Make your changes
git add .
git commit -m "Describe your changes"
git push

---

🚀 Move changes from Dev to Test (linear rebase):

git checkout Test
git pull --rebase origin Test
git rebase Dev
git push

---

📦 Move changes from Test to Prod (linear rebase):

git checkout Prod
git pull --rebase origin Prod
git rebase Test
git push

---

🔧 Feature Branch Workflow (Recommended):

git checkout Dev
git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature
# Do your work
git add .
git commit -m "Add my new feature"
git checkout Dev
git rebase feature/my-new-feature
git push

---

📖 Notes:

- Use git rebase instead of git merge to avoid messy merge commits.
- Protect Prod and Test branches in GitHub settings.
- Squash feature branch commits before rebasing.
- Avoid force-push on shared branches unless agreed by the team.

| Dev     | Active development       | Direct commits, squash, rebase |
| Test    | Staging for QA/review    | git rebase Dev             |

🔥 Resetting Branches and Squashing History

👉 Create a single-commit fresh history on any branch

1️⃣ Make sure you’re on the target branch:

git checkout main   # or Dev/Test

2️⃣ Create a new orphan branch (no history)

git checkout --orphan temp-main   # or temp-dev/temp-test

3️⃣ Add files to the new branch

git add -A

4️⃣ Commit all files as one commit

git commit -m "Initial commit with current project state"

5️⃣ Delete old branch

git branch -D main  # or Dev/Test

6️⃣ Rename temp branch to original

git branch -m main  # or Dev/Test

7️⃣ Force-push the new history (⚠️ destructive!)

git push --force origin main  # or Dev/Test

🚨 WARNING:
This deletes all old commits on the branch. Anyone else working with this repo will need to reset or re-clone.

🔒 Clean, linear, predictable history for everyone.
