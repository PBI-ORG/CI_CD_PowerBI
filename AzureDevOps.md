# CI/CD Solution for Power BI

Implementing CI/CD for Power BI with GitHub is essential for bringing structure, collaboration, and control to your report development workflow. It enables version control for Power BI projects, so you can track changes, collaborate safely, and roll back to previous states when needed. By automating deployments through connected branches and workspaces (Dev, Test, Prod), teams reduce manual errors, enforce consistent standards, and streamline the promotion of reports and datasets. Ultimately, this improves development speed, ensures data accuracy, and gives full visibility into how and when business reports evolve over time.
