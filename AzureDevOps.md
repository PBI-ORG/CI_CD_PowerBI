Automated deployment pipelines promote reports and datasets across workspaces (Dev, Test, Prod), minimizing manual effort, reducing errors, and enforcing consistent standards. This streamlined approach accelerates development, enhances data reliability, and ensures full visibility into how business reports evolve over time.
