# CI/CD Solution for Power BI

Implementing CI/CD for Power BI with Azure DevOps provides structure, collaboration, and governance for your report development lifecycle. By integrating version control with Azure Repos, teams can track changes, collaborate securely, and restore previous versions when necessary. Automated deployment pipelines promote reports and datasets across workspaces (Dev, Test, Prod), minimizing manual effort, reducing errors, and enforcing consistent standards. This streamlined approach accelerates development, enhances data reliability, and ensures full visibility into how business reports evolve over time
