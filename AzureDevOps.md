# CI/CD Solution for Power BI

Implementing CI/CD for Power BI with Azure DevOps provides structure, collaboration, and governance for your report development lifecycle. By integrating version control with Azure Repos, teams can track changes, collaborate securely, and restore previous versions when necessary. Automated deployment pipelines promote reports and datasets across workspaces (Dev, Test, Prod), minimizing manual effort, reducing errors, and enforcing consistent standards. This streamlined approach accelerates development, enhances data reliability, and ensures full visibility into how business reports evolve over time.

- Confirm your region (choose the region closest to your team for performance).  
- Click **Continue**.  

### 3. Name your organization
- Provide a unique name for your Azure DevOps Organization.  
- Your organization will be accessible at a URL like: URL: https://dev.azure.com/<OrganizationName>/ 

### 4. Create your first project
- Once your organization is created, set up a project.  
- Choose a **project name**, **visibility** (PRIVATE), and **version control system** (Git recommended).  
- Click **Create Project**.  

### 5. Invite team members (optional)

## üåø Branching Strategy

We recommend using three main branches to structure your development workflow in Azure DevOps:

- `main` ‚Äì Production-ready code (default branch).  
- `dev` ‚Äì Ongoing development work.  
- `test` ‚Äì Integration testing before merging into `main`.  

üìå In Azure DevOps, you can enforce branch policies (e.g., requiring pull requests, code reviews, or build validations) under **Project Settings > Repositories > Branches**. This ensures consistent quality and governance across your Power BI CI/CD pipeline.
