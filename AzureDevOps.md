# üîê Managing Repository-Level Access in Azure DevOps

When working with multiple Power BI teams, each team should have access **only to the repositories and workspaces they own**.  
This ensures isolation between teams while allowing project owners to retain visibility across everything.

---

## 1. Create a Team for Each Power BI Group
1. In your Azure DevOps project, go to **Project Settings ‚Üí Permissions**.  
2. Click **New Group** and create a team for each Power BI group, for example:
   - `TeamA-PowerBI`
   - `TeamB-PowerBI`
   - `TeamC-PowerBI`
3. Add the appropriate users (or Azure AD security groups) to each team.

---

## 2. Configure Repository Permissions
1. Navigate to **Repos ‚Üí Files**.  
2. From the dropdown, select the repository (e.g., `TeamA-PowerBI`).  
3. Click the **‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚Üí Manage Repository ‚Üí Security**.  
4. Search for the team you created (`TeamA-PowerBI`) and assign:
   - **Read** ‚Üí Allow  
   - **Contribute** ‚Üí Allow  
   - **Administer** ‚Üí (Optional, if you want them to manage repo settings)  

For other teams (e.g., `TeamB-PowerBI`, `TeamC-PowerBI`), explicitly set:  
- **Read** ‚Üí Deny  (we need to test this, If the team will be able to see the reposiroties just because they have access at the project level we need to create a project for eache team)

This prevents them from seeing or accessing the repository.

---

## 3. Owner Access
- **Project Administrators** (owners) automatically have full access to **all repositories** and can override permissions.  
- This ensures central governance while maintaining team isolation.

---

## 4. Example Setup

| Repository       | Team with Access | Other Teams   | Owner |
|------------------|------------------|---------------|-------|
| `TeamA-PowerBI`  | TeamA-PowerBI    | Denied        | Full  |
| `TeamB-PowerBI`  | TeamB-PowerBI    | Denied        | Full  |
| `TeamC-PowerBI`  | TeamC-PowerBI    | Denied        | Full  |

---

‚úÖ **Result:**  
- Each Power BI team can only see and work in their own repository.  
- Project owners can see everything.  
- CI/CD pipelines can still access all repos if configured with a service account.

## üåø Branching Strategy

We recommend using three main branches to structure your development workflow in Azure DevOps:

- `main` ‚Äì Production-ready code (default branch).  
- `dev` ‚Äì Ongoing development work.  
- `test` ‚Äì Integration testing before merging into `main`.  

üìå In Azure DevOps, you can enforce branch policies (e.g., requiring pull requests, code reviews, or build validations) under **Project Settings > Repositories > Branches**. This ensures consistent quality and governance across your Power BI CI/CD pipeline.


## üîó Connecting Azure DevOps to Power BI Workspaces

We integrate Power BI with Azure DevOps to enable source control and versioned deployment of reports and datasets across three separate environments:

- `Prod` workspace ‚ü∂ `main` branch  
- `Test` workspace ‚ü∂ `test` branch  
- `Dev` workspace ‚ü∂ `dev` branch  

---


### ‚öôÔ∏è  Link Azure DevOps to Power BI

1. In the Power BI service, navigate to the target workspace (e.g., `Dev`, `Test`, or `Prod`).  
2. Go to **Workspace Settings** > **Git Integration**.
3. Choose **Azure DevOps (Repos)** as the Git provider.
4. Click **Connect**.

6. Provide the required details when prompted:  
   - **Organization**
   - **Project** 
   - **Git repository**  
   - **Branch**: main,dev or test

     <img width="783" height="784" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1e057398-63a9-4754-8a0c-50794ba2f795" />
 
7. Click **Connect and sync**.  

Once connected, your Power BI workspace will stay in sync with the chosen Azure DevOps branch, enabling automated version control and structured deployments across environments.

## üìÇ Organizing Power BI Files in the Repository
To enable smooth integration of Power BI reports in our CI/CD pipeline, we recommend saving your Power BI project files using the Power BI Project (PBIP) format. This format breaks down your report into structured, source-control-friendly JSON files alongside the dataset and report definitions.

üìå Why Use .pbip?
Easier to track changes with Git

Enables code review and versioning for report definitions

Supports better collaboration and CI/CD automation

Avoids storing large binary .pbix files which aren't diff-friendly

üì• How to Save as PBIP
1. In Power BI Desktop (from version December 2022+), go to File ‚Üí Save As

2. Select Power BI Project Files (*.pbip)

3. Choose your project folder within the repository (if applicable)

##### ‚ÑπÔ∏è  If you don't have the option for saving a Power BI file as .Pbip you should enable the following options from Power BI desktop:

üìä CI/CD PowerBI Git Branching Strategies

Example with 3 branches:
- main ‚Äî live, production-ready state
- Test ‚Äî staging for QA and validation
- Dev ‚Äî active development

---

üîÄ Branching Flow:

Dev ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Main

- New features are developed in Dev.
- Approved changes are moved to Test for QA.
- Validated changes are promoted to Prod.

---

## Different Merging Strategies ##


### Using Git Merge ###

üì¶ Commands and Workflow

#### ‚úÖ Develop in Dev:

```bash
git checkout Dev
# Make your changes
git add .
git commit -m "Describe your changes"
git push
```
#### üöÄ Move changes from Dev to Test (with merge):

```bash
git checkout Test
git pull origin Test
git merge Dev
git push
```
#### üì¶ Move changes from Test to Main (with merge):

```bash
git checkout Main
git pull origin Main
git merge Test
git push
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7e58a4e4-231b-4cf6-be9b-b805cd12d19f)


When Performing a git merge, git will create a new "merge commit" that ties together the histories of both branches. But if we do this a lot, we end up with lots of knots, which can make the history a bit messy.

### Using Git Rebase ###

üì¶ Commands and Workflow

#### ‚úÖ Develop in Dev:
```bash
-git checkout Dev
-Make your changes
-git add .
-git commit -m "Describe your changes"
-git push
```

#### üöÄ Move changes from Dev to Test (linear rebase):

```bash
git checkout Test
git pull --rebase origin Test
git rebase Dev
git push
```


#### üì¶ Move changes from Test to Main (linear rebase):
```bash
-git checkout Main
-git pull --rebase origin Main
-git rebase Test
-git push
```




Before Rebase:

After rebase

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ff0f8c26-b2ef-4d69-8b08-56a9ed3bf9e2)

Using git rebase let us keeping a linear history.


### Using Git Squash ###

üì¶ Commands and Workflow

#### 1. Start from your development branch
```bash
git checkout Dev
```
#### 2. Create a feature branch
```bash
git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature
```
#### 3. Work and commit as usual (multiple commits possible)
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "First part of feature"
git add .
git commit -m "Second part of feature"
```
#### 4. Once your feature is ready, squash commits interactively
```bash
git rebase -i Dev
```

#### In the editor that opens:
- leave the first commit as 'pick'
- change the following commits to 'squash' or 's'
- save and close editor

#### 5. Move your squashed feature branch changes back into Dev (choose one):

#### Option A: Merge (creates a merge commit)

```bash
git checkout Dev
git merge feature/my-new-feature
git push
```

##### Option B: Rebase (linear history, preferred)
```bash
git checkout Dev
git rebase feature/my-new-feature
git push
```


Before

After

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/96a412c0-b02f-44e3-9404-ce64547041a4)


Squash commit keeps history linear but we lose teh fine details of individual feature commmits in the main branch's commit history.



üîß Feature Branch Workflow (Recommended):

```bash
-git checkout Dev
-git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature
-Do your work
-git add .
-git commit -m "Add my new feature"
-git checkout Dev
-git rebase feature/my-new-feature
-git push
```

üìñ Notes:

- Use git rebase instead of git merge to avoid messy merge commits.
- Protect Prod and Test branches in GitHub settings.
- Squash feature branch commits before rebasing.
- Avoid force-push on shared branches unless agreed by the team.

‚úÖ Summary

| Branch | Purpose                  | Move Changes With         |
|:--------|:-----------------------------|:----------------------------|
| Dev     | Active development       | Direct commits, squash, rebase |
| Test    | Staging for QA/review    | git rebase Dev             |
