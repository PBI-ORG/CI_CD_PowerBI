ðŸ“Š CI/CD PowerBI Git Branching Workflow

This project uses a linear history workflow with 3 main branches:
- Prod â€” live, production-ready state
- Test â€” staging for QA and validation
- Dev â€” active development

---

ðŸ”€ Branching Flow:

Dev â†’ Test â†’ Prod

- New features are developed in Dev.
- Approved changes are moved to Test for QA.
- Validated changes are promoted to Prod.

---

ðŸ“¦ Commands and Workflow

âœ… Develop in Dev:

-git checkout Dev
-Make your changes
-git add .
-git commit -m "Describe your changes"
-git push

---

ðŸš€ Move changes from Dev to Test (linear rebase):

-git checkout Test
-git pull --rebase origin Test
-git rebase Dev
-git push

---

ðŸ“¦ Move changes from Test to Prod (linear rebase):

-git checkout Prod
-git pull --rebase origin Prod
-git rebase Test
-git push

---

ðŸ”§ Feature Branch Workflow (Recommended):

-git checkout Dev
-git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature
-Do your work
-git add .
-git commit -m "Add my new feature"
-git checkout Dev
-git rebase feature/my-new-feature
-git push

---

ðŸ“– Notes:

- Use git rebase instead of git merge to avoid messy merge commits.
- Protect Prod and Test branches in GitHub settings.
- Squash feature branch commits before rebasing.
- Avoid force-push on shared branches unless agreed by the team.
