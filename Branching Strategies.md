ðŸ“Š CI/CD PowerBI Git Branching Strategies

This project uses 3 main branches:
- Prod â€” live, production-ready state
- Test â€” staging for QA and validation
- Dev â€” active development

---

ðŸ”€ Branching Flow:

Dev â†’ Test â†’ Prod

- New features are developed in Dev.
- Approved changes are moved to Test for QA.
- Validated changes are promoted to Prod.

## Different Merging Strategies ##


### Using Git Merge ###

ðŸ“¦ Commands and Workflow

#### âœ… Develop in Dev:

```bash
git checkout Dev
# Make your changes
git add .
git commit -m "Describe your changes"
git push
```
#### ðŸš€ Move changes from Dev to Test (with merge):

```bash
git checkout Test
git pull origin Test
git merge Dev
git push
```
#### ðŸ“¦ Move changes from Test to Prod (with merge):

```bash
git checkout Prod
git pull origin Prod
git merge Test
git push
```

When Performing a git merge, git will create a new "merge commit" that ties together the histories of both branches. But if we do this a lot, we end up with lots of knots, which can make the history a bit messy.

### Using Git Rebase ###

ðŸ“¦ Commands and Workflow

#### âœ… Develop in Dev:
```bash
-git checkout Dev
-Make your changes
-git add .
-git commit -m "Describe your changes"
-git push
```

#### ðŸš€ Move changes from Dev to Test (linear rebase):

```bash
git checkout Test
git pull --rebase origin Test
git rebase Dev
git push
```


#### ðŸ“¦ Move changes from Test to Prod (linear rebase):
```bash
-git checkout Prod
-git pull --rebase origin Prod
-git rebase Test
-git push
```

Using git rebase let us keeping a linear history.


### Using Git Squash ###

ðŸ“¦ Commands and Workflow

#### 1. Start from your development branch
```bash
git checkout Dev
```
#### 2. Create a feature branch
```bash
git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature
```
#### 3. Work and commit as usual (multiple commits possible)
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "First part of feature"
git add .
git commit -m "Second part of feature"
```
#### 4. Once your feature is ready, squash commits interactively
```bash
git rebase -i Dev
```

#### In the editor that opens:
- leave the first commit as 'pick'
- change the following commits to 'squash' or 's'
- save and close editor

#### 5. Move your squashed feature branch changes back into Dev (choose one):

#### Option A: Merge (creates a merge commit)

```bash
git checkout Dev
git merge feature/my-new-feature
git push
```

##### Option B: Rebase (linear history, preferred)
```bash
git checkout Dev
git rebase feature/my-new-feature
git push
```

Squash commit keeps history linear but we lose teh fine details of individual feature commmits in the main branch's commit history.



ðŸ”§ Feature Branch Workflow (Recommended):

```bash
-git checkout Dev
-git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature
-Do your work
-git add .
-git commit -m "Add my new feature"
-git checkout Dev
-git rebase feature/my-new-feature
-git push
```

ðŸ“– Notes:

- Use git rebase instead of git merge to avoid messy merge commits.
- Protect Prod and Test branches in GitHub settings.
- Squash feature branch commits before rebasing.
- Avoid force-push on shared branches unless agreed by the team.

| Branch | Purpose                  | Move Changes With         |
|:--------|:-----------------------------|:----------------------------|
| Dev     | Active development       | Direct commits, squash, rebase |
| Test    | Staging for QA/review    | git rebase Dev             |
| Prod    | Live, stable production  | git rebase Test            |
